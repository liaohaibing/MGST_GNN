Trajectory Generation
=====================

PySPLIT includes a method that calls HYSPLIT to generate trajectories
launched from a single location over as many months and years as desired in
a single comprehensive batch.


Requirements
------------

HYSPLIT installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Unlike the majority of PySPLIT, this feature requires a local installation
of HYSPLIT, which can be acquired from the NOAA ARL
here<http://ready.arl.noaa.gov/HYSPLIT.php>_.

The location of the `hyts_std` executable must be known.

Meteorology
~~~~~~~~~~~

This example uses the following GDAS files, freely available from the ARL:
* Weeks 1 - 5 of:
  * January 2007
  * August 2007
  * January 2011
  * August 2011
* Weeks 4 and 5 of:
  * December 2006
  * July 2007
  * December 2010
  * July 2011
* Week 1 of:
  * February 2007
  * September 2007
  * February 2011
  * September 2011
  
As GDAS files are in 3 hour intervals, the very last trajectories in January
and August will not generate properly without the third group of weeks.
As a general principle, meteorology data sets corresponding to the desired time
and geospatial extent must be available to successfully generate trajectories.
These data sets must be in the ARL-packed format.  All meteorology downloaded
through the HYSPLIT ARL data FTP is already in this format, and HYSPLIT
contains some utilities to convert other file types to this format. 
Acquistion of appropriate files and the nature of
the ARL-packed format and conversion is beyond the scope of this example,
and for more information consult the official `User's
Guide<http://www.arl.noaa.gov/documents/reports/hysplit_user_guide.pdf`_
if necessary before proceeding.

Prior to attempting trajectory generation with PySPLIT, the user should ensure
that meteorology file names follow a format of '*mon*YY*#' or '*mon*YYYY*#' where:

* '*' is a Bash-style wildcard
* 'mon' is a three-letter lower-case abbreviation of the month
* 'YY' or 'YYYY' is a two or four digit integer representation of the year 
* '#' is the number of the file within the month

For example, '*jan*07*2' will match files named 'gdas1.jan2007.w2' and
'edas.jan2007_2'.

This naming convention is required because PySPLIT examines file names to
determine which meteorology files correspond to the desired date of
trajectory launch.  It is strongly recommended that users keep meteorology
files of different types/origins, like the two files in the example above,
in separate directories as PySPLIT does not differentiate between the two.

Output along-trajectory meteorology variables may be selected by interacting
with HYSPLIT.


Generating Trajectories
-----------------------

As always, we begin by importing the package.
"""

import pysplit

"""
For clarity, we will define all required arguments outside of the method.

The first three arguments indicate locations of the HYSPLIT working directory,
the desired and existing trajectory storage directory, and the directory
that contains the meteorology files.  This example uses 1-degree weekly
GDAS archive meteorology downloaded via FTP.
"""

working_dir = r'C:/hysplit4/working'
storage_dir = r'C:/trajectories/colgate'
meteo_dir = r'E:/gdas'

"""
The next argument is the basename of each trajectory.  Each trajectory
filename will consist of this basename followed by the altitude and season,
and then the year, month, day, and hour in the format YYYYMMDDHH (unless
otherwise specified as YYMMDDHH)..
"""

basename = 'colgate'

"""
The following arguments are the initialization information for the 
trajectory generation run:  lists or ranges of years, months, hours (in UTC,
NOT local time), and altitudes in meters above ground level.
We also supply the tuple of initialization coordinates in decimal degrees,
which here indicate Colgate University in Hamilton, NY, and the integer run
time of the trajectories.  The trajectory direction in time is specified by
the sign of the run time (negative is backwards).
"""

years = [2007, 2011]
months = [1, 8]
hours = [11, 17, 23]
altitudes = [500, 1000, 1500]
location = (42.82, -75.54)
runtime = -120

"""
There are seven keyword arguments in this method.  The first is a slice object
that is applied to the range of days in each month, allowing us to generate
trajectories for all (default ``slice(0, 32, 1)) or a subset of days in each
month.  Here we choose to launch trajectories every other day. 

We have so far set up our run such that trajectories are launched every other
day in January and August, and their paths are calculated thence backwards
five days.  For trajectories launched at the beginning of a month, therefore,
we need meteorology data from the previous month.  The ``meteo_bookends``
indicates which meteorology files from the previous and next months are
needed.  As we are using weekly datasets, we need
weeks 4 (days 22-28) and weeks 5.  The default value (``[[4, 5], [1]]``)
also includes the first week of next month, which is critical when generating
trajectories with t=0 at the very end of the day..

The keywords ``get_reverse`` (default False) and ``get_clipped`` (default
False) control whether additional trajectory files are created.  A 'reverse'
trajectory is one launched from the endpoint of an original trajectory, and
run in the opposite direction.  A 'clipped' trajectory does not require
additional calculation, but is a copy of the original trajectory file
containing only path information.  This latter type is only strictly necessary
if using a version of HYSPLIT older than January 2017 (854), but we will acquire both
reverse and clipped trajectories anyway.

The keywords ``meteoyr_2digits`` (default True) and ``outputyr_2digits``
(default False) are critical in situations where users are dealing with
decades of meteorology files and trajectories.  In such a situation,
``meteoyr_2digits`` should be set to False.  If a user requires the old
file naming convention, ``outputyr_2digits`` should be set to True.  However,
``outputyr_2digits == False`` is preferred in general, and is required when
running non-21st century trajectories, as the file name will be the only
indication during trajectory loading of the century to which these trajectories belong.
In this example, we have only 21st century data and
our trajectory files will be generated just fine with the
default behavior of both keywords.

The final keyword argument is the location of the HYSPLIT trajectory
executable.  On Windows systems, this will usually be
'C:\\hysplit4\\exec\\hyts_std' (default value).  PySPLIT calls this
executable to calculate trajectories.

Let's call our method.  Only keyword arguments with values we have decided 
to change from default are included below.  This call may take several
minutes to complete, depending on your system parameters.
"""

pysplit.generate_bulktraj(basename, working_dir, storage_dir, meteo_dir,
                          years, months, hours, altitudes, location, runtime,
                          monthslice=slice(0, 32, 2), get_reverse=True,
                          get_clipped=True)

"""
When complete, ``storage_dir``, will contain 576 trajectory files, as well as two
folders, 'reversetraj' and 'clippedtraj', each containing 576 files.  Each file name
will end with a 10 digit string representing the date as YYYYMMDDHH.
